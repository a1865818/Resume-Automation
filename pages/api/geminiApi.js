üö® CRITICAL TENDER OPTIMIZATION RULES:
- Use EXACT terminology from the RFQ essential and desirable criteria
- Address every essential criterion with concrete evidence
- Incorporate government/regulatory sector language naturally
- Quantify achievements with metrics relevant to government value
- Prioritize government, regulatory, or public sector experience
- Use procurement terminology where applicable
- Structure content for evaluator scanning and scoring
- Maintain candidate authenticity while maximizing competitive positioning
- Include compliance-related experience prominently
- Demonstrate understanding of what RFTQ's required in processes and requirements
- Location must be based on the RFTQ's requirements, not the candidate's actual location.
- Security clearance: Include current status and eligibility for required level. If not applicable, return null.
- Experience section: Focus on most relevant positions to the RFTQ's requirements. The bullet points should directly relate to the Essential Criteria of the RFTQs using key words that would be pciked up on a search function or ATS system. Moreover, provide 3 most relevant positions with 3-4 main bullet points each with insightful details that directly related to the Essenti. For example if the RFTQ's requires are for a Business Analyst, you would provide the 3 most relevant positions to the requirements.
- Full experience: Include ALL positions but weight relevant work to the RFTQ's requirement more heavily.
- For fullExperience section: You MUST follow this NON-NEGOTIABLE rule: Each position can have ONLY 6-8 responsibility bullets - never more than 8, never less than 6. If the original resume has more than 8 points for any position, you are REQUIRED to merge, combine, and summarize related responsibilities into broader categories to fit exactly within the 6-8 limit. Example: Instead of listing 'Managed team meetings', 'Conducted performance reviews', 'Hired new staff', 'Trained employees' separately, combine them into 'Led comprehensive team management including conducting meetings, performance reviews, recruitment, and staff training initiatives.' This consolidation is MANDATORY - there are no exceptions. COUNT your bullets for each position and ensure you never exceed 8.
- If the experience has no responsibilities, do not add that position to the fullExperience section.
- Skills: Combine technical and regulatory/compliance skills strategically
- Format consistently for professional government submission standards
- If no referees are provided, return an empty array[] for the fields like "title", "name", "email", "phone". Otherwise, include their job title, name, email, and phone number (maximum 2 referees).

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - DIRECT MAPPING ONLY:
- DO NOT analyze, summarize, rewrite, or modify ANY text from the original resume.
- If the original text from resume has "-" or "+" or "." as the bullet point, neglect those bullets and only extract the text as it is, not the bullet point.
- Extract and copy the EXACT words, phrases, and sentences as they appear
- DO NOT combine, merge, or consolidate any bullet points or responsibilities.
- For relevant experience, copy the exact text from the original resume.
- DO NOT limit the number of responsibility bullets - include ALL as they appear
- DO NOT paraphrase or reword anything - use the precise original text
- If text spans multiple lines or bullets, copy each one exactly as a separate item
- Maintain original formatting, capitalization, and punctuation where possible
- If a section is not present in the resume, return null or empty array as specified
- For profile descriptions: Copy the exact text of any professional summary/objective sections
- For experience: Copy every single bullet point/responsibility exactly as written
- For skills: Copy the exact skill names/descriptions as listed
- For qualifications: Copy degree names, institution names, and dates exactly
- If referees are not provided, return empty array for the fields. If provided, copy exact details
- For affiliations: Copy exact organization names and membership details, or return "No information given" if not available

Your job is purely extraction and mapping - you are NOT an editor or summarizer.
