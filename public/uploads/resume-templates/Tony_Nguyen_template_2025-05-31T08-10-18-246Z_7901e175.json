    "description": "Tony Nguyen is a highly accomplished ICT Head of Delivery with a distinguished background in project and program management, boasting extensive experience leading complex software asset and lifecycle management initiatives.  His career at IBM has showcased his ability to oversee software procurement, licensing compliance, vendor negotiations, and adherence to regulatory frameworks.  His leadership in managing large-scale IT transformation programs at NSW Dept. Fair Trading and Westpac Bank has solidified his expertise in software deployment, governance, and risk mitigation strategies.  He possesses a proven track record of successfully managing multi-million-dollar portfolios, as demonstrated during his tenure as Asia Pacific CIO Program Director at IBM, where he established governance frameworks for software procurement and asset management across various regions.  His experience in integrated logistics support (ILS), compliance assurance, and risk assessment aligns perfectly with the demands of complex projects requiring meticulous software management and governance oversight.  His proficiency with software asset management tools, including JIRA, SharePoint, and Tivoli Asset Manager, further enhances his capabilities.",
    "description2": "Tony's expertise extends beyond technical proficiency to encompass strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.  He has consistently demonstrated the ability to engage stakeholders effectively, optimize project processes, and leverage Agile methodologies to drive efficiency and operational excellence across government and defense-related projects.  His success in leading and implementing Agile Transformation programs across the Asia Pacific region six months ahead of schedule, as well as establishing delivery centers across India, China, and the Philippines, showcases his ability to deliver impactful results within demanding timelines.  He has a proven ability to build and mentor high-performing teams, growing a delivery team from zero to over 600 practitioners.  His development of a new delivery operating model that saved IBM over AUD$1 million annually highlights his commitment to cost optimization and operational efficiency.  These experiences, combined with his strong technical skills and leadership qualities, make him an ideal candidate for roles requiring strategic thinking, operational excellence, and a deep understanding of software asset management and governance."
